# AGAR.IA

Hi, making an openAI gym oriented game, inspired by agar.io,
but meant to be played by competing artificial Intelligence.

Will probably switch to full gym environment once i know how.

The core features are : 
   - Optional rendering/headless (game = Agaria(rendering=True/False))
   - Meant to be played by multiple IA competing for ressource
   - AIBeginner Friendly
